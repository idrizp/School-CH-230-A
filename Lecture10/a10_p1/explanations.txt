a) By removing "using namespace std", we no longer bring in the standard library namespace into the global scope.
An alternative to using namespace std would simply be to explicitly prefix each statement that uses declarations from the
std namespace with std::, I.E std::endl, std::cout, etc.

b) When removing the class name's prefix, you can not access the object's data members. 
Potential alternative solutions would be to provide the object itself to the setHunger method, for example, and making the data member public,
which would go against best practices, but would work.
